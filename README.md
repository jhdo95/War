# War (The Card Game)
Getting Started: https://jhdo95.github.io/War/

Objective: The goal of the game is to win all the cards.

Players: 2

Preparation: Standard deck of 52 playing cards (no joker).

Setup: The deck of cards is divided evenly between both players (26 cards each). Each player will place their stack of cards face down, in front of them.

Ranking of Cards: Cards are ranked from 2 (lowest) to Ace (highest)

How To Play:
1. Each player will flip a card from the top of their deck onto the "battlefield". Whoever has the higher card takes both cards and adds them to the bottom of their deck.
2. If the cards are the same rank (suit not included), like a 9 of spades and 9 of hearts, it is "War"! Each player will then flip another card and the player with the higher card at the top takes both piles (4 cards). 
3. The game ends when one player has won all the cards or one player runs out of cards.

Important Notes:
1. If a player runs out of cards during a "War", they lose the game.
2. If the "War" situation happens again during a "War", the process repeats continually.

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, Javascript

Future Plans: Add some more depth to base CSS, Change background-screen during War to a "battlefield" arena,
